# XSScope

> **A simple XSS reflection checker tool**

---

### Description

XSScope is a lightweight command-line tool designed to quickly check if a target website reflects an XSS payload â€” helping you identify potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. It uses an external API to perform the scan and displays clear results in your terminal with colored output.

**This is a basic tool intended for quick checks and educational purposes.** It is *not* a full-featured vulnerability scanner or exploit framework.
